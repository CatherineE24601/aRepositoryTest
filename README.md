This is a repository test for commiting files.

In Feb.7. 2025, I commit a txt named codegeass.txt in github after sucessfully downloading a well-known llm DeepSeek-70B using vllm.

(Although the conda envs with vllm is already downloaded before I come here hhhhh(；´д｀)ゞ)

Maybe this is my second sucess since 2000((*>_<*) ,which means I rarely succeed since i was born in 2000 hhhh)

Codegeass is a well-known name in ACG, maybe you wil smile when you see the name of codegeass.txt.

Afterall, this is a familiar, impressive name.^_~✧
